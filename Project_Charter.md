# Static_Code_Checker (aka Nick hate's this idea)

## PROJECT CHARTER

Static_Code_Checker is a system used to help students check their own code and professors to grade a system. It takes input, output and an executable file and compares the two outputs.

### 1. Project Summary

Grading code is a very time-consuming task. We aim to make this easier for both students and professors alike. Students armed with an input and output file will be able to test their code against their professors expected outputs giving them the difference so they can correct prior to submission. For professors the application will be able to run and test students code and provided information on weither or not the inputs match.

### Scope



#### Goals and Objectives

This product will include

- A grading system
- The ability for students to edit code in the app
- Editable input files that feed input to the users
- Editable output files that check outputs against 
- Code compellation of the Java Programing Language
- Code compellation of the Python (c) Programming Language



#### Deliverables

- All listed functions as either
    - an easy to run executable file
    - a pip install-able package

#### Stakeholders


| Role | Interest / Impact |
|------|--------------------|
| Students      | To test their code against those of their professors                   |
| Professors    | Test and auto grade assignments from students                          |
| Interviewees  | Quickly compare answers to given questions with no IDE support         |

#### Out-Of-Scope

This product will not include

| Risk/Constraint/Assumption Title | Explanation |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Code completion for any available programing language  | It's expensive and unreasonable for a 3 month long project             |
| Code Linting or Control                               | We aim to edit raw text, this is not an IDE and should not be treated as such|
| This is NOT a web app                                 | Generates security flaws as users will be able to pass commands into the server |
| This application will not have all the answers        | This is not the be-all end all in coding education it is mearly <FIX> a tool|

#### Success Measurements

<

    Identify metric and target you are trying to achieve as a result of this project.  For example, overall cost savings of $50K or reduce processing time by 25 percent. This can be in comparison to other systems available that are similar to the one you are developing.

### Signatures

<

The signatures of the people below document approval of the formal Project Charter.  The project manager is empowered by this charter to proceed with the project as outlined in the charter. Note: For the purpose of submission, you do not have to sign the document. Just fill your name and date.

### Appendix A

<

As necessary, a glossary of terms specific to the project and its deliverables may be included.  Also append any relevant details and reference documents.

Below is a guide to the roles identified in the template.  The quoted text is from the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide.

Note:  any one individual may hold multiple roles in the project; for example, the Project Champion and the Project Sponsor are often the same.

The Stakeholders generically are people or groups (departments, committees, etc.) that have a vested interest in the project.  There is a distinction made between those who have a tactical interest in the product of the project (the “customers”) and those who have a more administrative or strategic interest (the “stakeholders”).
Stakeholder:  “…may have a financial interest in the project, contribute inputs to the project, or have an interest in the outcome of the project.”
Customer:  the end-users; those who will use the product of the project.

The Project Leadership comprises those who will guide and coordinate the execution of the project.
Project Champion:  “…the person or group … serving as spokesperson to higher levels of management”; that is, someone who is representing the project to senior management and is the “public face” of the project.
Project Sponsor:  “…the person or group who provides resources and support … and is accountable for enabling success [and] serves as an escalation path”; that is, the person or group who helps clear any obstacles and holds the project manager accountable.
Functional Project Owner:  “… are the persons or organizations who will approve and manage the project’s product, service, or result”; that is, the primary customer, the person or group that is responsible for the functionality of the end product.
Project Manager:  “…assigned to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.”; that is, the person responsible for the execution of the project and delivery of the end product.

The Project Team comprises those who will do the work of the project, producing the end product(s).  These roles are flexible, and generally include: Developers, who produce the product; Subject Matter Experts (SME), who provide the details of the necessary functionality; Testers, who verify the developer’s work; and the End Users, who validate the SMEs work.

The Ongoing Use and Maintenance Roles are flexible and generally include:  Contract Administrators, who lead the relationship with the vendor(s) or other units; the specific group for OIT Support, to account for future technical needs; and the Functional Roles needed to properly use the project’s product.

### Additional Notes

<

-	Overall grading is based on the completeness of the document.
-	After completing the document, remove the unnecessary text or sections from the document.
-	The document should be well-formatted using headings and/or subheading as needed.
-	Perform a spelling and grammar check on your document. These documents should be written using professional language and should not have any grammatical or spelling errors.
-	Make sure the table is not broken on two pages.
-	Add appropriate information in the header and footer as shown in the template.
-	Number and name the tables and figures included appropriately.
-	Update the table of contents once the document is complete.
-`	To complete sections such as success measurements you need to complete some research to find systems that similar to your idea.
