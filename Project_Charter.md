### 1. Project Summary

Grading code is a very time-consuming task. We aim to make this easier for both students and professors alike. Students armed with an input and output file will be able to test their code against their professors expected outputs giving them the difference so they can correct prior to sumbition. For professors the application will be able to run and test students code and provided information on weither or not the inputs match.

### Scope

<
    Specify what will and will not be included in the project, including end products, who they affect, and how they will be introduced. 
    
>

#### Goals and Objectives

<

-	Clear and well-define list of project objectives.
-	Use a bulleted list (NO PARAGRAPHS)
-	List specific objectives. Example: Create required webs services and database for the application.
-	Grading is based on clear and well-defined list of objectives, do not use stories. 


>


#### Deliverables

<

- Identify the tangible items delivered by this project (e.g., requirements, new software modules, business process changes, training), organized logically, such as in functional terms and/or by project phase/calendar. 
- Mention any platforms and/or frameworks which you plan to use.
- Example: web-based front-end app, desktop application. Provide details (Bulleted list, sub-list)
- Grading is based on well-defined deliverables described in details.


>

#### Stakeholders
{

•	Identify individuals and departments with a strategic or tactical interest in the project.
•	Grading is based on completeness of this table.


}

| Role | Interest / Impact |
|------|--------------------|
|      |                    |

#### Out-Of-Scope

<

- Outline explicitly those items not included in the project (e.g., features of a tool not being implemented, or departments/user groups removed from a process as part of a change).
- Mention the reason for each item not being a part of this project. Example, time-constraint, optional feature, etc.
- Use bulleted list.

| Risk/Constraint/Assumption Title | Explanation |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
|                                  |             |

#### Success Measurements

<

    Identify metric and target you are trying to achieve as a result of this project.  For example, overall cost savings of $50K or reduce processing time by 25 percent. This can be in comparison to other systems available that are similar to the one you are developing.

### Signatures

<

The signatures of the people below document approval of the formal Project Charter.  The project manager is empowered by this charter to proceed with the project as outlined in the charter. Note: For the purpose of submission, you do not have to sign the document. Just fill your name and date.

### Appendix A

<

As necessary, a glossary of terms specific to the project and its deliverables may be included.  Also append any relevant details and reference documents.

Below is a guide to the roles identified in the template.  The quoted text is from the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide.

Note:  any one individual may hold multiple roles in the project; for example, the Project Champion and the Project Sponsor are often the same.

The Stakeholders generically are people or groups (departments, committees, etc.) that have a vested interest in the project.  There is a distinction made between those who have a tactical interest in the product of the project (the “customers”) and those who have a more administrative or strategic interest (the “stakeholders”).
Stakeholder:  “…may have a financial interest in the project, contribute inputs to the project, or have an interest in the outcome of the project.”
Customer:  the end-users; those who will use the product of the project.

The Project Leadership comprises those who will guide and coordinate the execution of the project.
Project Champion:  “…the person or group … serving as spokesperson to higher levels of management”; that is, someone who is representing the project to senior management and is the “public face” of the project.
Project Sponsor:  “…the person or group who provides resources and support … and is accountable for enabling success [and] serves as an escalation path”; that is, the person or group who helps clear any obstacles and holds the project manager accountable.
Functional Project Owner:  “… are the persons or organizations who will approve and manage the project’s product, service, or result”; that is, the primary customer, the person or group that is responsible for the functionality of the end product.
Project Manager:  “…assigned to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.”; that is, the person responsible for the execution of the project and delivery of the end product.

The Project Team comprises those who will do the work of the project, producing the end product(s).  These roles are flexible, and generally include: Developers, who produce the product; Subject Matter Experts (SME), who provide the details of the necessary functionality; Testers, who verify the developer’s work; and the End Users, who validate the SMEs work.

The Ongoing Use and Maintenance Roles are flexible and generally include:  Contract Administrators, who lead the relationship with the vendor(s) or other units; the specific group for OIT Support, to account for future technical needs; and the Functional Roles needed to properly use the project’s product.

### Additional Notes

<

-	Overall grading is based on the completeness of the document.
-	After completing the document, remove the unnecessary text or sections from the document.
-	The document should be well-formatted using headings and/or subheading as needed.
-	Perform a spelling and grammar check on your document. These documents should be written using professional language and should not have any grammatical or spelling errors.
-	Make sure the table is not broken on two pages.
-	Add appropriate information in the header and footer as shown in the template.
-	Number and name the tables and figures included appropriately.
-	Update the table of contents once the document is complete.
-`	To complete sections such as success measurements you need to complete some research to find systems that similar to your idea.
