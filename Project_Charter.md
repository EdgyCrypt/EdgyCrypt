### 1. Project Summary

Grading code is a very time-consuming task. We aim to make this easier for both students and professors alike. Students armed with an input and output file will be able to test their code against their professors expected outputs giving them the difference so they can correct prior to submission. For professors the application will be able to run and test students code and provided information on weither or not the inputs match.

### Scope



#### Goals and Objectives

This product will include

- A grading system
- The ability for students to edit code in the app
- Editable input files that feed input to the users
- Editable output files that check outputs against 
- Code compellation of the Java Programing Language
- Code compellation of the Python (c) Programming Language



#### Deliverables

- All listed functions as either
    - an easy to run executable file
    - a pip install-able package

#### Stakeholders


| Role | Interest / Impact |
|------|--------------------|
| Students      | To test their code against those of their professors                   |
| Professors    | Test and auto grade assignments from students                          |
| Interviewees  | Quickly compare answers to given questions with no IDE support         |

#### Out-Of-Scope

This product will not include

| Risk/Constraint/Assumption Title | Explanation |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| not support Code completion for any available programing language  | It's expensive and unreasonable for a 3 month long project             |
|  not support Code Linting or Control                               | We aim to edit raw text, this is not an IDE and should not be treated as such|
| This is NOT a web app                                 | Generates security flaws as users will be able to pass commands into the server |
| This application will not have all the answers        | This is not the be-all end all in coding education it is mearly <FIX> a tool|

#### Success Measurements

<

    Identify metric and target you are trying to achieve as a result of this project.  For example, overall cost savings of $50K or reduce processing time by 25 percent. This can be in comparison to other systems available that are similar to the one you are developing.
