1. This week we 
	- worked on improving the look and feel of the application
	- Worked on the module that compiles code
2. We believe that what we had aimed for was feasible however not all items were completed due to an unexpected complexity
3. There is no customer hence no questions can be asked
4. Because we are pair programming it really eliminates questions, the only thing that was brought up was validations of design concepts
5. From here we will be getting the buttons wired up and then moving into testing phases
6. For more information please refer to the meeting minutes document
