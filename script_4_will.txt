[run project]
Hi All, Will here,

First a reminded or what this project is, we aim to make a code testing suite
that allows users to upload and edit their own files, and test it against input files and output files

[go through the teacher and interviewer pages]
whats happened here in the front end was a little bit of remolding to make it look nicer moving forward we plan on picking and going with a solid color theme

you may have noticed that I skipped the students page and thats because we have started linking the front and back ends there

if we select files (there is one output and one java file in Project/Test Case/). We can hit run, now nothing happens here because we are still trying to hook everything together.

If we switch over to the terminal we will see that we managed to get an object back from the webpage {POST ImmutableMultiDict([('args', ''), ('output', ''), ('program', '')])}

There is some more stuff done in the back here [open the directory], here we have new runner scripts all these do is handle the different PyPi requirements and starts the scripts as well

Going into the package we see a new compiler file, I will not open cause its large and confusing and quite honestly scares me a little, but it can compile down java and python code

In the next week we want to keep working on syncing the front and back ends, and continue making the front look better
